[h1] Equivalent Exchange [/h1] 

A partial port of the Equivalent Exchange (aka ProjectE) mod from Minecraft, this mod allows you to convert items into EMC and back again. So far, it adds the EMC system as well as the Transmutation Tablet and the Energy Condenser.

[h2] Features [/h2]
- [b]EMC System[/b]: Every item has an EMC value, which determines its worth. Every item can be converted into EMC and back again, given the right tools. While not guaranteed, items will tend to have as much EMC as their constituent ingredients.
- [b]Transmutation Tablet[/b]: A hardmode item crafted from the Philosopher's Stone, 4 obsidian, and 4 stone that allows you to convert items into EMC and back again. The UI is opened by right clicking the Transmutation Tablet item in your inventory with the inventory opened. EMC is stored not by the tablet, but by the player. Players can 'learn' items by placing them in the tablet, which will also transform the item into EMC. Learned items can be created at any time, as long as the player has enough EMC to do so. Note that items consumed by the tablet will lose any special properties. Player can also unlearn items by placing the item into the unlearn slot. The tablet supports searching for items by name, and will display the EMC value of items in the tooltip.
- [b]Energy Condenser[/b]: A pre-hardmode item crafted from 6 diamond, 2 ruby, 10 obsidian, 10 stone, and 1 chest that acts as either a chest or an item duplicator given a template to duplicate and items as EMC fuel. Place and then right click the Condenser to use it. The Energy Condenser will, if given a template, consume items not the same as the template placed into it and convert them into EMC, albeit at a fixed rate of some number of items per second. Likewise template items can only be created at a fixed rate of some number of items per second. While far more cumbersome to use than the Transmutation Tablet, the Energy Condenser can be used to make duplicate items with the same special properties as the template item.
- [b]Multiplayer Support[/b]: The EMC system is stored per player, so each player has their own EMC and learned items. Moreover, the Condenser has been designed to work in Multiplayer. A player cannot open a Condenser that another player is using, but as soon as the other player closes it, the first player can open it and use it. There is a known issue where if a player Alt-F4s while using the Condenser rather than disconnecting properly or closing it normally, the Condenser will be left in a state where it cannot be used by any player until the server is restarted.
